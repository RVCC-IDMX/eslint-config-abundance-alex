# Why use ESLint?

## Let's learn an ESLint rule.

Since JavaScript allows for no semi colons at the end of statments when writting code, eslint has a "semi" rule which helps us out with this. It is considered best practice to write code with semi colons at teh end of staments to avoid the JS engine confusion. There are two options for this rule according to the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/rules/semi) documentation.

We have ours configured to always. This way we can avoid confsing the JS engine and we can have proper use of the semi colon after statements and object when we write our code.

Happy coding!
